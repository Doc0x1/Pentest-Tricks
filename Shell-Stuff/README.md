# Shell-Stuff includes many different things
The files in here could be just a powershell .ps1 profile for you to use to make pentesting easier with some pre-defined functions, it could be pre-made bash or zsh shells, web shells, etc..

## WIP
- Currently I've only uploaded a .ps1 profile file that I created for my Kali Linux VM for making it easier to use powershell when pentesting. I'm sure there will be more things to come though.
