# Pentest-Tricks
This is a repository of useful tips/tricks/resources/code/one-liners for Ethical Hacking purposes.

## Information
Not quite sure how I'm going to end up organizing this compilation yet, but hoping to do a better job of keeping things easy-to-find and organized than some of the others I've seen out there.
I'm thinking two folders (Windows/Linux) that each have their own README.md explanation in them that can further guide people throughout the compilation.
There will certainly be a lot of information in here at some point if it actually gets large, so most likely subsections will be required to further help guide people to what they are looking for.

## As for general tips and tricks
For general tips/tricks/one liners I'm considering having a single file inside each folder for all tips/tricks/commands that others might find helpful.

## Suggestions
If you have any suggestions regarding this repo, you probably know already how to get in touch with me or someone that does. If not, check below.
